- We had an exceptionally tasty lunch. Khichdi, green chutney, dahi. #mother reminisced about #nani. She'd say *Let's have something light*, get Khichdi made from Vinita Aunty, but then end up eating tons of it and would joke *Vinita! इतनी स्वाद खिचड़ी मत बनाया कर* (Vinita, please stop matching kuch tasty Khichdi. We end up eating so much of it!)
