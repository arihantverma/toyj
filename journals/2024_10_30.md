		- fixed the `instant.schema.ts` schema.
			- ## Problem
				- I wanted to segregate entitiesMap completely so that I be able to see a nice neat object of all the tables together instead of having to scorll down
			- ## Solution
				- I don't exactly how but the association of `entitiesMap` and `linksMap` wasn't as `graph` exactly expected to let types across the function so instantdb flow properly.
				- I was first trying `const entitiesMap = {...} as const` and `const linksMap = {} satisfies LinksDef<typeof entitiesMap>` but that was cutting it.
				- I then did
				  
				  ```ts
				  function createGraph<
				    EntitiesWithoutLinks extends EntitiesDef,
				    const Links extends LinksDef<EntitiesWithoutLinks>,
				  >(entities: EntitiesWithoutLinks, links: Links) {
				    return [entities, links] as const;
				  }
				  ```
				  Which replicated the `i.graph` function signature exactly and it started working properly
