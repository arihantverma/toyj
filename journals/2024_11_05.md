	- 'Finding your voice', Neil Gaiman Masterclass
		- Make mistakes, by:
			- > You learn more by finishing a failure than by writing a success. And you definitely learn more by finishing a failure than you ever do by beginning something that's fantastic but stops
		- Write, finish.
	- 'American Transparent Style' ( American Gods written this way ), Stephen King does it sometimes. The Author is invisible—You do nothing to draw attention to yourself. Narrative voice—disappears into the text.
	- Ocean At The End of the Lane: First person—what's important? The voice of the narrator.
		- The voice of sone holding hand, looking in the eye and saying, 'let me tell you what happened to me'. I used it in Violent cases (graphics novel), Mr. Punch, a bunch of short stories. It's convincing. "Look I'm not going to lie to you, I'm going to tell you true things, hold my hand, we're going to walk together into a dark place, it's safe, I'm holding your hand," and then you walk them into the dark place, leave hand, and walk away. "Oh my gosh, I trusted things, I thought I knew I was happening."
		- This particular style would be an interesting one for anyone to imitate of me.

		- Describe yourself as a writer. Pretend to be a different person explaining what your work is like to someone who has never read it. Doesn't have to be perfect, write immediate thoughts and impressions. If struggling, read few pieces and describe what they have in common. What similarities exist in your work? Over ones: i.e. you always use the same genre or same type of characters; quieter ones i.e. attitude, emotional registers etc…
		- Give short selection of your writing to someone else and ask them to describe it in three adjectives. Do they recognise you in the writing?
		- ***Challenge yourself to write a short story in one sitting*** to fight fear of mistakes. You're not allowed to go away from the project until you have a completed draft. It can be any length, but tell a complete story that will satisfy a reader. Don't do too much editing while you write, let your ideas flow and then structure them once you've got everything on the page.
