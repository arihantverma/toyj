	- Use only for heading fonts, body fonts should be more or less consistent across devices. Most big companies keep it at 1rem;
	- ```css
	    h1 {
	      font-size: clamp(
	        1.5rem,
	        4vw + 1rem,
	        3rem
	      );
	      margin-bottom: 0.5em;
	    }
	  ```
	- | 6vw | 24px | 48px | 96px |
	  | calc(4vw + 1rem) | 16 + 16 = 32px | 32 + 16 = 48px | 64 + 16 = 80px |
	  | calc(5vw + 2rem) | 20 + 32 = 52px | 40 + 32 = 72px | 80 + 32 = 112px |
	  | clamp(2.5rem, 4vw + 1rem, 4rem) | 40px (clamped) | 32 + 16 = 48px | 64px (clamped) |
	- > clamp doesn't require calc, it has it inbuilt as a utility
	- second half `1rem` helps with font increasing if user default font size changes => this helps with accessibility
	- 4vw = 4% of viewport. So for 1000px viewport, 4vw = 40px;
