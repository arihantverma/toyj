	- The `<strong>` HTML tag is meant to convey that an element is critically important or urgent, like “**Warning: Product may explode if shaken**”.
	- `<b>` is used to draw attention to text *without* implying that it's urgent or important
	- The `<em>` HTML tag is used for emphasis, the way one might emphasize a particular word in a sentence, like “these pretzels are making me *thirsty*.”
	- `<i>` is used to highlight “out of place” content, like
	   a foreign word, or the internal thoughts that a character is having in 
	  fiction.
	- `line-height` is a bit of an odd duck because it takes a *unitless number*. This number is multiplied by the element's `font-size` to calculate the actual line height. It's possible to pass other unit types (eg. pixels, rems), but I recommend always using this unitless number, so that the line-height 
	  always scales with the element's font-size.
	- Experimental: A newer way to automatically proportion line height:
	  
	  ```css
	  * {
	    line-height: calc(1em + 0.5rem);
	  }
	  ```
	  Instead of calculating the line height by multiplying the font-size with a number like 1.5, this alternative uses the font-size as a base, and adds a fixed amount of space to each line.
	  
	  > One downside is that we have to set it on all elements with `*` instead of applying it to the `body`. This is because the `em` unit doesn't inherit well; it won't recalculate the value of `1em` for every element. On this blog, for example, it broke my code playgrounds, because the third-party code assumed that line-height was inheritable, as it usually is.

	- **To comply with accessibility guidelines, our body text should have a minimum line-height of 1.5.** This is according to [WCAG 1.4.12, Text Spacing guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html).
