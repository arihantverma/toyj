	- #daadimaa #people whispers when she wants to confine what she's saying within a radius of 2 meters. If I had to take help of an onomatopoeic uttering, it's the most archetypal susurration of barely detectable sounds. The sound itself feels like she's scheming for a coup. The sound, often times in the meaning of it as well, is an exchange of gossip. It's a fascinating sound – it begets secrets. I've traditionally disliked listening to that sound. It has always symbolised the possibility of difference in information behind one's back. As if that 2 meter surrounding cloud holds the tools for turning someone around. But lately, I've found, that it is also used to procure information about someone's well being or lack thereof. Whispers of ambivalence. [contriving, conniving]
