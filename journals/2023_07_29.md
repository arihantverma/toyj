	- > Please note, you shouldn't actually set a `px` font size on the `html` tag. This will override a user's chosen default font size. If you really want to change the baseline font size for rem units, you can do that using percentages:
	  
	  ```html
	  html {
	    /* 20% bigger `rem` values, app-wide! */
	    font-size: 120%;
	  }
	  ```

	  <b> and <i>?
	  Before we had <strong> and <em>, we had <b> (for bold) and <i> (for italic). When HTML5 came around and introduced semantic markup, these two tags were deprecated.
	  
	  In the years since, however, these tags have been un-deprecated, and given new semantic meaning:
	  
	  <b> is used to draw attention to text without implying that it's urgent or important.
	  <i> is used to highlight “out of place” content, like a foreign word, or the internal thoughts that a character is having in fiction.
	  Now, I'll be honest: I rarely use <b> and <i> myself. I don't know why you'd want to draw attention to something that isn't important. And it isn't clear to me what the semantic benefits are of the <i> tag.
	  
	  It is important to use semantic HTML, and we'll see plenty of examples throughout this course. My personal opinion is that I'd rather focus on higher-impact things.

	- We can calculate the actual height of each line by multiplying the font size (2rem) by the line-height (1.5), for a derived value of 3rem.
	  
	  ```html
	  p {
	    font-size: 2rem;
	    line-height: 1.5;
	  }
	  ```
	  
	  By default, browsers come with a surprisingly small amount of line height. In Chrome, the default value is `1.15`. In Firefox, it's `1.2`.
	  
	  These default values produce densely-packed lines of text which can be hard to read for people who are dyslexic or have poor vision. **To comply with accessibility guidelines, our body text should have a minimum line-height of 1.5.** This is according to [WCAG 1.4.12, Text Spacing guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html).
	- As we saw earlier, these are the “built-in” styles for `<a>` tags:
	  
	  ```css
	  a {
	    color: -webkit-link;
	    cursor: pointer;
	    text-decoration: underline;
	  }
	  ```
	  
	  The trouble is that even though `color` is an inheritable property, **it's being overwritten by the default style**, `color: -webkit-link`?.
	  
	  We can fix this by explicitly telling anchor tags to inherit their containing text color:
	  
	  ```html
	  <style>
	    a {
	      color: inherit;
	    }
	  </style>
	  
	  <p>
	    This paragraph contains <a href="#">a hyperlink</a>!
	  </p>
	  <p style="color: red;">
	    This is a red paragraph with <a href="#">another link</a>.
	  </p>
	  ```
	- These alternatives are known as ***logical properties***
	  
	  ```css
	  p {
	    display: block;
	    margin-block-start: 1em;
	    margin-block-end: 1em;
	    margin-inline-start: 0px;
	    margin-inline-end: 0px;
	  }
	  ```
