		- > What we used to do was make the guys say three rude things so we could then go into sexy talk. The regulators who rang the lines to check on us were not allowed to do this. We started all calls with customers with three questions. What are you doing right now? Usually the answer would be a rude version of 'playing with myself'. Then we would say something like 'What would your rather be doing?' Usual answer would be 'F***ing you' or something similar. Then it would be some variation of 'And how would you do that?'. We basically had to get them to say some very explicit stuff and swear/slang words before we could go into sex talk. Funnily enough, a lot of the callers were regulars and knew the drill.

Some guys wanted to hear you urinate on the toilet (always kept a glass of water next to the loo), high heels walking across a floor (high heels on a coffee table), a wet pussy was a mouthful of water and a finger squishing around in there or a piece of latex with some lube and of course a vibrator had to always be on standby.

The system would automatically hang up ever hour as a reminder to the caller about how much money he was spending. Depending on the line he rang in on, it was 1.95 a minute or 3.95 a minute. I got about a dollar a minute. Not bad sitting at home in my comfy clothing watching tv with closed captions whilst pretending to be in sexy nightwear with an insatiable sexual appetite!
