	- [7+ million Postgres Tables | Kaliash Nadh | IndiaFOSS 2024 | FOSS United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhi5Q_wL9i0)
	- a queueing system that sits between backend server/middleware and main big database, so that millions of requests don't choke the database which is handling complex multi second queries for generating reports
	- hack: instead of getting the data from this main big db, the reports get stored in ephemeral reports db, from which any filter, sort queries can then be run on, sparing the main db from this future queries. There's a middleware that handles requests to reports. Zerodha's solution: [dungbeetle](https://github.com/zerodha/dungbeetle/tree/master), specifically made for separating reporting layer decoupled from any app or database.
