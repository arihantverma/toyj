## The Wayward, Absurd, Mundane, 'Useless'
- #[[Books Notes]] Apart from the course readings, I read the following from a link in the footnotes of Ramchandra Guha's [[The Cooking of Books]],
  
  > He was garrulous and would spend hours energetically illuminating visitors with arcane information, leaving them simultaneously shattered and enriched. I met him just twice. The first time he told me, ==apropos of nothing==, that the American declaration of independence, printed in 1776, was typeset in Caslon, and that his eternal regret was not to be able to print history books in Caslon because he did not possess the full range of that typeface. On the second occasion, he said that ==reading a nicely set page in Bembo is as effortless and pleasurable as eating a rossogolla, except that this has been true for Bembo more than 400 years whereas the rossogolla has no such pedigree.== Such charming items of 'useless' information do not flow out of printing houses today. Printing standards, specially for full-colour picture books, are vastly higher than they were in P.K. Ghosh's heyday. You can get a book looking just the way you want it by clicking mice. The pity is only that the last Indian printer-scholar is dead. Several of his successors will print material as efficiently as he did once, but none will radiate that personality and no one will harbour many of those ==endearing nuggets of uselessness==.
