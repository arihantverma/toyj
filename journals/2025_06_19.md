		- > Former OF girl. Iâ€™m well educated, but Iâ€™m from a poor country and Iâ€™m a breadwinner. I was so so lucky, my first client was a sweet man, widower. He just wanted company and some play time. Second client, I was even luckier. She was a lovely woman. Just lonely, her first time ever on OF, trying it out. Everyone else after were pigs, I really felt like an object. I was dissociating a lot, hated my body. But I stayed on for the money to pay for school (masters, mind you) and my parentsâ€™ hospital bills.
		  >
		  > Until my second client, the woman, whom I had gotten close to, offered me a large sum so I could leave the business and focus on finishing my degree and getting another job where I was safer. I stopped. We kept in touch, got even closer. Fell in love. Weâ€™re dating now. Iâ€™m in a good job and I graduated. Been 2 years now, happy and safe!

		- > stressful af - meeting someone new and then Doing Sex as a service instead of for fun was definitely anxiety provoking
		  >
		  > edit: to expand on this a bit - for me, I think most of the jitters came from the fear that I would disappoint the client in some way. what if he sees my body irl and doesn't like it? what if I'm too awkward? what if I'm not as good at tomfoolery as I thought? what if he wants me to ride him but I lose my balance and break his dick and accidentally punch him in the face while trying to catch myself??

		- > I was having some sort of mental episode (manic) and it numbed me to the whole experience. I was in such a weird state at that point in time. I thought it was fine at that point but after I had come out of that self harming state I realized I did not want other clients like that.  Could have been worse though.

		- > never set it up i wasnâ€™t sure how to, i pay for premium i probably couldâ€™ve done it, but a lot of consumers want special content which a chatbot canâ€™t really provide #chatgpt

		- > Second time with a different guy, not that anyone asked, after cuddling he just wanted to cum in my mouth. So i knelt on the floor with my mouth open while he masturbatedâ€¦ i stayed there feeling stupid because i had no sense of how close he was. Finally right before he came he grabbed my face with one hand and shoved the tip of his cock in my mouthâ€¦ aaaand I came. This was the first time I ever let someone cum in my mouth and my first orgasm without anyone touching my body. I think all the anticipation + an extremely repressed upbringing was so exciting that it pushed me over the edge.

		- > Iâ€™m not romantically attracted to men but have a good time sexually and enjoy their company so it was very easy for me to not have any emotional messiness.

		- > My first SW experience was with a man I met through seeking arrangements. We had an ongoing thing where he genuinely helped me to get off drugs and encouraged me to do better, he became my SD and even offered me a job in his company if we agreed not to mention our past. I turned him down and sadly he passed away months later, he had Cancer and never told me. I think about him often especially when setting and achieving my goals.

		- > Very uncomfortable. It was a sugaring arrangement, the guy told me that it would be a threesome with a female fuck buddy of his he wanted to cheer up. I got there and met her first, and she was really young (like 21, I was 30 so I never hook up with anyone under 25) and really clearly anxious - shaking, pale, which I thought was strange.
		  >
		  > He got there and was like... cartoonishly ugly in a way that was not at all clear from the photos. I figured out through the interaction that she was also being paid. He tried to lowball me and I had to firmly remind him that wasn't the price we agreed to. I spent the whole interaction just mentally focusing on her (I'm bi anyway and she was very pretty) and trying to make it a positive experience for her because she was straight and seemed so nervous. She said in a soft kind of amazed voice "You're so beautiful" and that was the only moment that was a bit sweet.
		  >
		  > Never saw him again (ghosted him) but I texted a bit with her and we meant to meet for coffee but never did. She said when we texted that she didn't like doing it and that man made her uncomfortable but she needed the money for her kid, made me really sad. I told her not to use her real phone number and to please be careful and safe. I still think about her sometimes and hope she's okay, she didn't reply last time I texted so I don't want to reach out and remind her again if she stepped out of that lifestyle.
