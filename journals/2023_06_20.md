- [[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]] [[tv series]] Episode 6, Season 4
	- Midge goes to meet the journalist who writes shit peaces for her. The amount of ignorance to not even admit what Midge is saying — asking her how hard it is for a woman to listen to met in the clubs they go to, let alone make them laugh — and instead turn it into her own reason of 'it's tough to be a woman in journalism – that when she writes about her the publishers just gobble that piece and run it – clearly not taking journalism seriously ( she made fun of the journalist who writes about politics, corruption, yada yada…, she says after proudly telling that she's bagged his desk), ***are the worst kind of hypocritical, ignorant people in the world*** to deal with. It's inhumane, they are inhuman. It's so difficult to make anybody understand anything when they don't even want to leave their mind for 30 seconds and listen to the person who's talking to them.
