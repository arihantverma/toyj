- `cw` (normal mode): deletes the end of current word + switch to insert mode
- `dw` (write mode): delete word under cursor
- ## How to open vim without customisations
- `vim -u NONE -N`: open vim without customisations
	- > The -u NONE flag tells Vim not to source your vimrc on startup
	- > When Vim starts up without loading a vimrc file, it reverts to vi compatible mode, which causes many useful features to be disabled. The -N flag prevents this by setting the â€˜nocompatibleâ€™ option
	- > Some of Vimâ€™s built-in features are implemented with Vim script,
	  which means that they will only work when plugins are enabled. This file
	  contains the absolute minimum configuration that is required to activate
	  Vimâ€™s built-in plugins:
		- ```vim
		  "essential.vim
		  set nocompatible
		  filetype plugin on
		  ```
			- `vim -u code/essential.vim`
- `!q`: quit editor discarding any changes made
- `x` (n): deletes character under cursor
- Many commands that change text made from: **Operator** and **Motion**
	- `d <motion>`: d for delete and motion for particular motion
	- Motions:
		- `w`: until the start of next word, EXCLUDING its first character
		- `e`: to the end of the current word INCLUDING its last character
		- `$`: to the end of the line, INCLUDING last character.
		- `0`: to the start of the line
		- ***Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator will move the cursor as specified***
			- *this can be added with numbers for that jump, example `2w` for 2 word jump*
- `dd`: delete the whole line
	- similarly `2dd` delete two lines
- `u`: undo
- `U`: undo all changes on a line
- `<C-r>`: redo
- `p`: (paste) put previously deleted text **after** the cursor
- `P`: **before** the cursor
- `rx`: replace <r> cursor selection with <x>
- `R`: to replace more than one character ( the weird insert mode in document editors just made sense ðŸ˜…)
- `ce`: to change from the cursor until the end of the word. This initiates write mode.
	- `c` is for change
	- all other motions work like with `d`
- ## Cursor Location and File Status
	- `<C-g>`: shows *location of file* and *file status* of file
	- `G`: go to the bottom of the file
	- `gg`: go to the top of the file
	- `<number> G`: go to line
- ## Search Command
	- `/`
		- `n`: next occurence
		- `N`: Back to the previous occurence
	- `?`: search for words in backward direction
	- `<C-o>` takes you to older positions
	- `<C-i>` takes you to newer positions
	-
- ## Matching Parenthesis Search
	- Go to any parentheses -> `%` -> cursor moves to matching parenthesis
- ## Substitute Command
	- `:s/thee/the` (first occurrence of `thee` is substituted with `the`) in one line
	- `:s/thee/the/g` same but for all occurrences of the line
	- `:%s/old/new/g` substitute in the whole file
	- `%s/old/new/gc`: whole file, but with a prompt as to substitute or not
	- `:1,4s/old/new/g` change every occurrence of a character string between two lines (1, 4)
- ## Execute External Command
	- `:! <external command> + enter`
- ## Selecting Text to Write
	- `:w` save file
	- `v` -> start visual selection
		- `:w text.txt` -> write selected text in `text.txt`
- ## Retrieving and Merging Files
	- `:r <filepath>` -> will copy content from that file and paste it at cursor
	- `:r !ls` -> read output of external command and puts it below the cursor
- ## Open Command
	- `o`: open insert mode on line below the current one
	- `O`: open insert mode on line above the current one
- ## Append
	- `a`: append after cursor
- ## Copy Paste
	- `y` (operator) yank (copy)
		- `+y`: copy to system clipboard
		- `+yy`: yank the current line to system clipboard
		- can use with motion
	- `p`:  paste
	- `P`: put before cursor rather than after
- ## Set Option
	- `:set ic`: ignore case
		- `:set noic`
	- `:set hls`
		- `:set nohls`
	- `:set is` (incremental search)
		- `:set nois`
	- add `inv` prefix to any of these commands -> toggle
	- `:help`
	- `<C-w><C-w>`: switch between windows
	- in the command mode -> write any letter + `<C-d>` autocompletes available commands -> tab to go through
