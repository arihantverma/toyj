	- `p:first-child`-> the p tag which is also the first child of its container
	- `p:first-of-type` -> the p tag which is the first occurrence of p tags in its container
- **pseudo elements**:  don't target specific state (like pseudo classesâ€”`:hover, :focus, :first-of-type, :first-child, etcâ€¦`, but target sub-elements within an element, e.g. `::placeholder, ::before, ::after`: *these selectors target elements in the DOM that we haven't explicitly created with HTML tags.*
	- Try not to use `::before; ::after`, because their behaviour with screen readers is inconsistent + they are syntactical sugar for 'secret' spans->just use spans instead. Can be used for visual trinkles.
