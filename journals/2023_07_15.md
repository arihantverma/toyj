	- I think my mother has extremely high house work standards. She wants out of the core being, out of the good habit to keep everything cleaned, spick and spanned. Household helps, already battling their own domestic and personal challenges, when shouted upon instructions for how **exactly** to do work, doesn't motivate them exactly to learn to do things how she wants. An understated restraint builds up in them. The threshold to want to learn how she wants it, so that the shouting and instructions would lessen, faces another mountain to cross — mood and the state of mind. When she'd be angry, frustrated, tired, she'd be shouting anyway, no matter even if the work is being done how she wants.
	- Despite back and body pains, my mother doesn't stop, she can't, until she sees everything set and clean in a way she wants.
	- As she's been getting older, at least she has started giving up when the limits of her body have started reaching their limits.
	- I had never pitched in myself tactically to spin a way that allows her to see that I need to learn what she needs to be done, so that I can do a little bit of it if not much. For example making one meal out of three. I've been taking advantage of her getting tired. Still, on days when I'd ask her why she's stretching to wash the night utensils when I could do it, she'd ***just it's almost done***, that's it. So I started taking advantage of her soaps on TV. She'd sit to watch one before she got to sneakily washing utensils. I'd start washing utensils as silently as possible. Is she'd hear me washing them and say something, I'd throw tantrums, like playfully singing at the top of my voice or shouting gibberish jocosely.
	- It's superbly unfair that all the men (and women really sadly) has taken it as a given that it's her responsibility to do everything household AND do a full time job. When I had to work along with my flatmates in COVID, cook meals and things, it was the first time I realised how resilient and strong my mother has always been. Any man in the family would die of frustration and anger before they could reach half the work that my mother did everyday, for even a week.
	- Today she got up and did everything, but got extremely burnt out. After she'd given me breakfast (and I feel so terrible about the fact that I don't get up in the morning myself and help her out), she said ***Ari, meri bas hogayi ab.*** She went on to vent about having to take care of multiple houses — Majra, Nahan, Mohali, Shoghi. It is a little too much.
	- A new household help here in Shoghi was fearing not knowing how to do some things — like how much Liquid utensils soap to put in the container. Knowing that mother was heated up because of the tiredness of ***having*** to do things herself, when she came into the kitchen and saw that she had put a little too much, before she could say anymore than ***Arre, itna zyaada daal diyaaa, kya karte ho***, I pitched in and said that she was new, she'd learn once you tell her to. In my mind I thought ***How could one possibly get to learn everything without being told on the first day.*** Amma assured me that it's just the way of her talking. Then she went onto saying her ***Don't fear okay? My son thinks I speak loudly only when I'm angry, it's just how I speak sometimes, so don't fear.*** The household help being a humble person, was obviously a little shaken visibly, anybody would be, when you raise your voice up in an inflection of a sentence that shows disappointment and anger. Of course, I couldn't say this to my mother, she doesn't listen, never will. The past traumas of people taking her for granted, has by nature, strengthened her ego to demand the right to raise voice to get things done her way whenever necessary. It's difficult to deal with that part of the ego, but I also know that if it's not dealt with compassion and listening intently and sometimes crushing one's own ego to tell that she's not right, it's going to get more brittle.
	- I finally convinced her that she should grab me by my ear and teach me how to cook the way she had always wanted. So I'm making poha this afternoon. Poha because we had had a heavy breakfast, and we need something light. Wish me luck that I do decently, that her mood is more forgiving if I don't, and that she holds me to teach me and that I learn.

	- Yesterday I cracked a tech problem, I had been thinking to solve since 2019. How to make a dynamic navigation menu that takes into account that —  if you click on a nav item and it starts scrolling the page down — elements get dynamically added ( perhaps because of virtualisation or intersection observer) and the scroll stops prematurely at an unintended section. I wrote a hook in [[reactjs]] for a use case in office. I'm going to write my first fully tested [[open source]] library for it. I'm excited about it!
