		- > Sorry to get graphic, but she would end her set by fucking a liquor bottle. It would be empty and afterwards customers would always try to put it in their mouth or at least smell it. I told her she should use a premium bottle but fill it up with cheap liquor. Then charge customers for a shot after she fucks it. It sent her tips through the roof and she became our top earner by far.

		- > You start having to pay for everything, including outfits, working, and makeup. Luckily at my club, there was a house mom who took care of us

		- > They're not paying to access me or my thoughts, they want my body to project their fantasies onto
		- > I got good at dancing. I never enjoyed being touched, but I could disconnect and do a good job of it. By three months in I was a really good stripper. But the first few shifts were emotionally exhausting. It's normal to associate sex with emotional connection, it takes time to disconnect that.

		- Very very interesting comment about why seasoned strippers compete fiercely with 'new fish'.
		- > And I don't see that as shallow. In the backroom, or after the shift, I will do a lot. I've put my arm around girls while they cried. I have done their makeup. I have answered random texts late at night when they have a crisis of conscience, I have girls bus money to get home because they couldn't handle it but were so broke they didn't have money for the bus, they literally used their last penny to get there and didn't even get one dance in. I once shaved a hairy buttcrack.
		- > But all of that happens off the floor. The moment I am on the floor I am only a stripper, a sexy object for male desire and the occasional chick. Do not approach me, do not expect me to display positive emotion to you, do not expect on-floor coaching, I'm busy being fuckable. We are in competition. If you can't handle it, go to the backroom or go home and text me. ==I'm not human right now, nor are you as long as you're on the floor, we're strippers.==

		- > Note that you never get a refund, if a stripper walks off before your time is up she keeps the money. Note to creeps, pay per song, don't pay up front.

		- > did the usual buildup to grinding, pretty soon I was grinding on his crotch while he felt my tits and was panting and saying "oh god you're tits are fucking hot" over and over again. Cute but basic, he needs to work on his voice and range of words.
