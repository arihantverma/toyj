	- I just got to know that Pal uncle, Nanu's best friends for over probably 40 years, took a big commission (20%) to help sell Nanu's crores worth of land. Pal uncle and Pal aunty, both doctors, are superbly rich people in life. I'm just surprised as to where does the 'more more more' stop, at least among helping friends.
