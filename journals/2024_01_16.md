	- # position layout
	- ## absolute
	- default position (without using top, left, right, bottom) of an absolutely position element is it's ***in-flow position***, but the elements/text around it slips below it.
	- absolutely positioned elements 'comes out of the flow'
		- When the browser is laying out elements, it effectively pretends that 
		  absolutely-positioned elements don't exist. They're “incorporeal”: you 
		  can stick your hand right through them, like a hologram or a ghost.
	- In the following code, `top`, `left` are given preference.
	  ```html
	  <style>
	    .box {
	      position: absolute;
	      top: 50px;
	      left: 50px;
	      right: 50px;
	      bottom: 50px;
	      width: 100px;
	      height: 100px;
	      background: deeppink;
	    }
	  </style>
	  
	  <div class="box"></div>
	  ```
	  
	  the following code centres at the middle, because `auto` is a hungry value. There are 4 important ingredients for this trick to work:
		- absolute positioning (`position: absolute`)
		- Equal distances from each edge (ideally `0px`)
		- A fixed size (defined `width` and `height` properties)
		- Hungry margins (`margin: auto`)
		  
		  ```html
		  <style>
		  .box {
		    position: absolute;
		  /* equivalent of top, left, right, bottom 0 = inset: 0;*/
		    top: 0px;
		    left: 0px;
		    right: 0px;
		    bottom: 0px;
		    width: 100px;
		    height: 100px;
		    margin: auto;
		    background: deeppink;
		  }
		  </style>
		  <div class="box"></div>
		  ```
