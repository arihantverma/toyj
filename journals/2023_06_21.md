	- When Snibril thought a termagant was behind him.
	  
	  > It's here, he thought. It's right behind me. If I turn around, I'll be turned to stone. But if I don't turn around, will I be turned to supper?

	  > After a while the shuffling grew fainter, and he risked the briefest look. In the dim light he could see something bulky, at least twice as tall as he was, disappearing among the hairs.

	  > ***I ought to call everyone, he thought. But they'll run around and shout and give one another orders and trip over things, and then it will have long gone.*** But I've got to do somehting. Otherwise we'll soon have a statue that goes *ping* when it should go 'Hello'.
- [[toyj]] [[work]]
	- My fixed compensation was 3,015,000 rupees per annum. Today it was raised to 3,075,301. I got a fucking **2%** raise in my fixed compensation. Yet I'm not angry. I should be but I am not. Perhaps because I've given up hopes of doing anything interesting in this company or to be of any value.
	- My variable compensation increased from 335,000 to 542,700. Potential 62% increase. I know I'm not going to get it because
		- I don't have a clearly defined career path. I don't know what I'm going to work a week from now. I don't know what impact I'm going to make from it. This is the reason I know that I'm not going to make it a rating of > 3.2 out of 5. A 100% payout happens at 4. 3% gets 80% (I think). So it's 4,34,160, which 29.6% increase.
	- So I've *potentially* a raise of (((3075301 + 434160) - (3015000 + 335000)) / (3015000 + 335000)) * 100 = **4.76%**. Brilliant! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 🤦🏻
	- I got this as my review from a wonderful ( no sarcasm ) manager, that has recently quit the company –
		- > Being senior frontend engineer expectation is high to contribute at platform level more, last year most of your time was consumed within us-stocks funnel with little impact on business, tech metrics. A lot more participation at framework level and generalisation of solution is needed.
		  
		  It feels like I'm working against the company instead of for it. There are no clear projects for the web team, no clear prospect of what we want to achieve in a quarter and why. Everything is ad hoc. In a situation and a company state where everyone is volatile and ready to erupt, where I don't feel comfortable having discussions with my tech leaders for a clearer path ( and this is a big onus on me, I'm responsible here ), it's difficult to chalk out a career path. That's the reason I've been feeling stuck.
		- The individual feedbacks that I got for individual tasks, I'd contest were utterly wrong, because my manager had no idea about the implementation details of those tasks. Some of the feedback he wrote is upfront wrong. I think it has been because there has been a set image of me set in his mind, since we started working together in late 2018, and that image hasn't change. That image of the character he thinks I am ( I'm supposing, this is all a supposition ) slacks and slides, doesn't put enough effort. It wasn't clearly me in the last few quarters, I worked, I made reusable components, increased performance, worked, like everyone else in our team. But none of us are appreciated or told that we did a good job, as frequently as we deserve.
	- I want to leave.
