	- # Margin Collapsing
	- block direction margins collapse and only in flow layout.
	- only adjacent elements collapse, the following will not have margin collapsing
	  
	  ```css
	  <style>
	    p {
	      margin-top: 32px;
	      margin-bottom: 32px;
	    }
	  </style>
	  
	  <p>Paragraph One</p>
	  <br />
	  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
	  ```
	- asymmetric margins: bigger one wins
	- nesting doesn't prevent collapsing, in the following margin collapses.
	  
	  ```css
	  <style>
	    p {
	      margin-top: 48px;
	      margin-bottom: 48px;
	    }
	  </style>
	  
	  <div>
	    <p>Paragraph One</p>
	  </div>
	  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
	  ```
	  
	  Margin will always try and increase distance between siblings, **even if it means *transferring* margin to the parent element!** In this case, the effect is the same as if we had applied the margin to the parent `<div>`, not the child `<p>`.
	- ***Margin collapsing blocked by blocked by padding or border***: You can think of padding/border as a sort of wall; if it sits between two margins, they can't collapse, because there's an obstruction in the way.
	- Blocked by a gap [didn't understand the example fully]
	- Blocked by a scroll container
		- it will disable margin collapse if the margins are on either side of the scroll container.
		- **Margins must be touching in order for them to collapse.**
	- Margins can collapse in the same direction
		- ```html
		  <style>
		    .parent {
		      margin-top: 72px;
		    }
		  
		    .child {
		      margin-top: 24px;
		    }
		  </style>
		  
		  <div class="parent">
		    <p class="child">Paragraph One</p>
		  </div>
		  ```
	- ### The frustrating case of unwanted margin
		- ```html
		  <style>
		    .blue {
		      background-color: lightblue;
		    }
		    .pink {
		      background-color: lightpink;
		    }
		  
		    p {
		      margin-top: 32px;
		    }
		  </style>
		  
		  <section class="blue">
		    <p>Paragraph One</p>
		  </section>
		  <section class="pink">
		    <p>Paragraph Two</p>
		  </section>
		  ```
		  
		  In this scenario, you might expect the two sections to be touching, with the margin applied inside each container.
		  
		  This seems like a reasonable assumption, since the `<section>`s have no margin at all! The intention seems to be to increase the space within the top of each box, to give the paragraphs a bit of breathing room.
		  
		  The trouble is that **0px margin is still a collapsible margin. **Each section has 0px top margin, and it gets combined with the 32px top margin on the paragraph. Since 32px is the larger of the two, it wins.
		- ***More than two margins can collapse***
			- ```html
			  <style>
			    header {
			      margin-bottom: 10px;
			    }
			  
			    header h1 {
			      margin-bottom: 20px;
			    }
			  
			    section {
			      margin-top: 30px;
			    }
			  
			    section p {
			      margin-top: 40px;
			    }
			  </style>
			  
			  <header>
			    <h1>My Project</h1>
			  </header>
			  <section>
			    <p>Hello World</p>
			  </section>
			  ```
			  
			  In above paragraph wins out of the 4, so separation is 40px.
