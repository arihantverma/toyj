	- My gravatar description from when I was 23 years old:
	  
	  > Beyond time and space is the self and its unborn and undying stories ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡§® ‡§§‡•ã ‡§¨‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à|. The prophecy of the unknown insinuates that I was on this earth many times before 23 years ago. I'm just another cartoon in the world. I write poems, short fiction. I code sometimes. I like ergonomic mechanical keyboards but can't afford them. I'm a non sticky pan to events ü•òüç≥. My favourite song is 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World' by Tears for Tears
