- My #mother reminisced about students in her career in whose lives she made an impact. She has been able to make a lot of impact in a lot of students' life across her reluctant ( she wanted to and had many opportunities to do something other than teach ) teaching career. She keeps telling about those students. Today she told about
	- A conductor asked for my mother for her ticket. She said she'd lost it. The conductor said
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  
	  > Never mind, you can't find your ticket, I couldn't find marks in your mathematics exam.
	  
	  The conductor kept both of his hands on his face, to the mother's surprise of course. He said with a grin
	  > Do you remember me and how you used to punish us all?
	- When mum visited the local hospital once. A girl, now a doctor, whom mother had taught, got up from her seat (meeting with her after a really long time)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  
	  > Ma'am this seat is yours
	- Another an academically mediocre girl, who now works in the banking sector maybe (my mum doesn't exactly know) and works for HNWI's. She'd given a speech on her mother's farewell about my mum, how students forget what teachers teach
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  > But the life she taught in between teaching Physics is sticking everyday of my life.
- At the same time my mother also remembered wistfully about the opportunities that sadistic and orthodoxy elements in her life denied her
	- ***JTO Junior Telecom Officer***
		- When I was just discovered in mum's womb, my father had seen a job application in the newspaper and applied on my mother's behalf. It was the only year, or one of the few years that M.Sc. Physics graduates were eligible to apply. My mother had been selected. But my paternal grandmother, who had already a misogynistic, sexist streak going on against my mother (still does), said (rather declared) that she will not in any circumstance get an officer's desk job 🤷🏻‍♂️
	- ***Mahaveer Spinning Mills***
		- After BSc my mother got an opportunity to work in Mahaveer Spinning Wheel. My maternal grandfather didn't let her go on account of bad people working at the place and that it wouldn't be safe to work there. 5kms from home. 🤷🏻‍♂️
- I'm also #watching The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel. What brilliant writing! In season 4 in an episode Midge breaks down after being taken for granted too much, no credits given to her for all the things she was doing for her kids and her parents (she bought back their house for loony's sake!). She tells sarcastically to her young daughter something on the lines of *It's always the men.*
