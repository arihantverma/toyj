	- Amma's family's friend from Chamba met with Amma's grandmother and said
	  > Tussa kutha de asaan kutha de, kutha de kutha aaike mile
	  
	  (***Aap kahan ke, hum kahan ke, aur dekho kahan aake milre hain***)
	  (***See where you are from, and where are we from and it's such a wonder that we are meeting here.***)
	  
	  And amma's grandmother said to Nani
	  > Eh ki kutta kutta karri kanni hai
- A wrong number to amma asking
  > Kuttha galaayide? (where are you speaking from)
  
  And Amma replying back
  > Mu taan galaaayide (speaking from the mouth)
