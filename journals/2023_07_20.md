	- It'd be interesting to solve granular replace for strings across codebases/CMSes. Kamal keeps coming with the requirements of replacing words when a policy or rule or feature changes. And to replace all those phrases and substrings is a mess.

	- I'm a little angry today. At first I was angry at my brother for having been submissive, afraid, communicating late and on so many other things. At least 6 months since 2020 have revolved in firefighting the situations he's got himself in. But I zoomed out and realised I am angrier at patriarchy more. Had my mother been given more resources in life, was not blackmailed to not study the things that she wanted to study, didn't marry with a person who had lied about a lot of things before marriage, been treated at least a little more fairly if not equivalent to boys in the family by her father who has been misogynistic his whole life, even at 80, when his hands shake and has problem peeing and after the death of his wife, the household would have been rock solid, I might not have been born, there would be one home where everybody could stay peacefully, submissive habits born out of doing household chores AND working full time would never have been born. Emotions might most likely have been more stable in the family.
