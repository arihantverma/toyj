	- > If we *don't* specify a border color, it'll default to using the element's text color! If you want to specify this behaviour explicitly, it can be done with the special `currentColor` keyword. `currentColor` is always a reference to the element's derived text color (whether set 
	  explicitly or inherited), and it can be used anywhere a color might be 
	  used:

	  Why? because *the `border-radius` property rounds an element even if it has no border!*
	- > Outlines are stacked outside border, and can sometimes be used as a "second border", for effect:
	  
	  > Outlines will follow the curve set with `border-radius` in all modern browsers. This is a relatively recent change, which landed in browsers between 2021 and 2023.
	  
	  > **Outlines have a special `outline-offset` property**. It allows you to add a bit of a gap between the element and its outline.
	- > `width: auto` has a different meaning for replaced elements.
	   It doesn't mean “stretch out and fill all of the space”, it means “use 
	  your natural width”!
