	- ## Home that you were born in
		- ***Thandedar, Narkanda***, pleasant summers, snowy winters, apply orchards. Memories of my mother's impressions of me, stories filled with laughter, eccentricity, struggles, with a wistful, but proud smile. ***Majra****,* cricket with village boys on a newly harvested field. Cycling 5kms to sit on the slanted spillway canal wall and throw stones. Playing and talking with the toads that croaked and jumped near my feet as I sat to ðŸ’©. Sneaking into heavy winter quilts and seeing ocean and catching fish and letting them go. Thinking about the girls that I liked in my class and thinking that it showed on my face, as my parents put me to sleep. ***Nahan****,* extracurriculars, sports, walking in narrow long market ways that connected one part of the town to other. Chasing a burglar away on the even of Sanskrit exam. Loving physics and math. Bout with a principal to the brink of rustication and boasting to friends about it. Teenage love. ***Summer vacations at Nani's in Mohali.**** *Getting up really late. Kadha Parshad, Matthi with Aachar, Kadi Chawal. Something always sweet in the fridge up for grabs. Road Rash on Massi's Desktop, Swat Cats at 4pm on Cartoon Network. A/C, Dominoes and McDonald's. Home I was born in shielded me from family fights and drama, and I was treated with utmost care, truly nurtured.
	- ## Home that you made
		- I moved out of my parents' home after 10th grade. I've always made home at difference places since then. A small room in a PG in Kota. Sharing rooms with college mates and then most awaited single room in final year. A PG sharing during my first job, elated that my room mate had a night shift. A 1BHK flat with a genius college classmate for some months, then a 3BHK with two best flatmates one could find.
	- ## Home that you found/didn't
		- Anytime there's a disenchantment towards a place, I've found it to become less of a home. Growing up in Nahan, I didn't like the grossness and crassness in the language that most people spoke. Backward thought spilled through language irrevocably, ignorantly and shamelessly.
		- Very good friends dropped out of life without reason, sometimes intimation, that felt like holes on the terrace of a home I thought they were.
